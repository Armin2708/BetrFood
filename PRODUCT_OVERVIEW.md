## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Key Risks

**1. Chicken-and-Egg Problem (Cold Start)**
- **Risk**: No users without content, no content without users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Seed platform with curated recipes (licensed or created)
  - Recruit food bloggers/influencers as early adopters
  - Incentivize content creation (early creator fund)
  - Launch in tight niche audience first (e.g., plant-based, keto)

**2. Competition from Tech Giants**
- **Risk**: Instagram/Meta could add recipe/planning features
- **Mitigation**:
  - Move fast, build engaged user base before they notice
  - Integrated experience hard to replicate (Instagram can't suddenly become MyFitnessPal)
  - Focus on food-specific features giants won't prioritize
  - Build data moats and user loyalty

**3. Content Moderation at Scale**

- **Mitigation**:
  - AI-powered content screening for common allergens
  - User reporting system
  - Verified nutritionist review for featured content
  - Clear disclaimers and liability protections

**4. AI Hallucination & Liability**

  - Train AI on curated, verified cooking knowledge
  - Disclaimers on AI responses
  - Human review for high-risk queries (allergen substitutions)
  - Insurance for platform liability

**5. User Privacy Concerns (Dietary Data)**
- **Risk**: Users hesitant to share health information
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strong privacy controls (dietary profile optional)
  - Clear data usage policies
  - No selling of individual user data
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance from day one

**6. Content Quality Control**
- **Risk**: Low-quality user-generated recipes flood the platform
- **Mitigation**:
  - Community voting and rating systems
  - AI-powered quality screening for completeness
  - Verified creator program for trusted sources
  - User reporting and moderation systems
  - Featured content curation
