  - Grocery list apps (AnyList, Out of Milk)
  - Calorie trackers (MyFitnessPal, Lose It!)

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Key Risks

**1. Chicken-and-Egg Problem (Cold Start)**
- **Risk**: No users without content, no content without users
- **Mitigation**:
  - Seed platform with curated recipes (licensed or created)
  - Recruit food bloggers/influencers as early adopters
  - Incentivize content creation (early creator fund)
  - Launch in tight niche community first (e.g., plant-based, keto)

**2. Competition from Tech Giants**
- **Risk**: Instagram/Meta could add recipe/planning features
- **Mitigation**:
  - Move fast, build deep community before they notice
  - Integrated experience hard to replicate (Instagram can't suddenly become MyFitnessPal)
  - Focus on food-specific features giants won't prioritize
  - Build data moats and community loyalty

**3. Content Moderation at Scale**
- **Risk**: User-generated recipes could be unsafe (allergen misinformation)
- **Mitigation**:
  - AI-powered content screening for common allergens
  - Community reporting system
  - Verified nutritionist review for featured content
  - Clear disclaimers and liability protections

**4. AI Hallucination & Liability**
- **Risk**: AI gives bad cooking advice, someone gets sick
- **Mitigation**:
  - Train AI on curated, verified cooking knowledge
  - Disclaimers on AI responses
  - Human review for high-risk queries (allergen substitutions)
  - Insurance for platform liability

**5. User Privacy Concerns (Dietary Data)**
- **Risk**: Users hesitant to share health information
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strong privacy controls (dietary profile optional)
  - Clear data usage policies
  - No selling of individual user data
  - GDPR/CCPA compliance from day one

**6. Meal Planning Quality**
- **Risk**: AI-generated meal plans are mediocre, users lose trust
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with user-selected recipes (they choose what to combine)
  - AI assists rather than fully automates
  - Community upvoting surfaces best meal plans
  - Iterate based on user feedback
